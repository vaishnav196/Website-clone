                <h1>QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH</h1>
                <P>When numbers and figures come together to form a proper analysis, it is called quantitative research.
                    It is majorly used to find patterns and averages, make predictions, and generalize results to a
                    wider population. Quantitative research is widely used in understanding customer psychology and to
                    get accurate marketing positioning.
                    .</P>
                <br>
                <p>One Way Solution gives you in-depth research by making your result as authentic as possible. From
                    digging in the correct numbers to presenting you with proper facts and figures, all the boxes are
                    ticked under one umbrella.</p>

            <h1>HOW DOES QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WORK?</h1>
            <p>This approach is used when you want to create social awareness or generate knowledge about the ongoing
                situation. Unlike qualitative research, there is no room for opinions or decisions derived through
                debates. Here, numbers, data, and graphs play a major role.</p><br>
            <p>Using advanced tools and having subject matter experts on board, One Way Solution helps to give you a
                narrower result by giving comprehensive solutions to all the pain points.</p>

                            <h1>Descriptive research</h1>
                            <P>Here, analysis takes place to derive the current status of an identified variable. These
                                research projects are designed to provide systematic information about a particular
                                phenomenon. There are no assumptions involved in the beginning here, but it comes into
                                the picture after collecting relevant data. The information is collected in a
                                standardized manner and each unit is studied carefully to start the hypothesis of the
                                project.</P>
                            <p>Now, this method is majorly used to understand human behaviour in various situations.
                                Some common examples of this could be how scientists feel about global warming, how
                                fifth-grade students spend their time during summer vacations, how parents feel about
                                the twelve-month school year, etc</p>

                                several facts. This will determine the trends and patterns in data and there is no
                                manipulation of information done here. They are identified and studied in their absolute

                                laboratory. It is a study where an effort is made to identify and impose control over
                                every other variable except one.</P>
